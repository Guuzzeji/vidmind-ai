# Calculate Pricing of idea

Img tokens = 85 * 3
85 = base cost of prompting a img
3 = number of images


prompt tokens = 411 + 255
411 = cost for text prompt
255 = cost of img prompt

Overall Cost = (((0.01 / 1000)  * 666 ) *29)  + (((0.03 / 1000) * 130) *29)
666 = prompt cost
29 = number of requested need to do to fully read video
130 = tokens need for generating a answer back
